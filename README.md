# pubcrawl
A Pub Crawl app -- DAT504 Project

As of latest commit:
-- Run app.js from project folder
-- Go to localhost:3000

Page should display with The Cider House pinned on the map. The location is stored as lat/long in the mLab database and forwarded to the map draw function (found in public/js/script.js).

Right now, the Mongo data is being written into a .json file in the public folder whenever the app is started from node. We could do with pulling the array directly and dynamically, if possible (without bridging through a local text file which gets updated once per app start).
